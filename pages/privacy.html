            <h3>By Law or to Protect Rights</h3>
            <p>If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</p>
            
            <h3>Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
            <p>We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.</p>
            
            <h3>Marketing Communications</h3>
            <p>With your consent, or with an opportunity for you to withdraw consent, we may share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
            
            <h3>Affiliates</h3>
            <p>We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.</p>
            
            <h3>Business Partners</h3>
            <p>We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services, or promotions.</p>
            
            <h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
            <p>We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the Website to help customize the Website and improve your experience. For more information on how we use cookies, please refer to our Cookie Policy posted on the Website, which is incorporated into this Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <h2>Third-Party Websites</h2>
            <p>The Website may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including advertisements and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the Website, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information. Before visiting and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other sites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Website.</p>
            
            <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.</p>
            
            <h2>Policy for Children</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.</p>
            
            <h2>Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <h2>Options Regarding Your Information</h2>
            <p>You may at any time review or change the information in your account or terminate your account by:</p>

            </ul>
            
            <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.</p>
            
            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
