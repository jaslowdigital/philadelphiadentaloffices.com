                <h2 class="faq-question">❓ What are dental implants?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Dental implants are permanent, natural-looking replacements for missing teeth. A dental implant is a small titanium post surgically placed into your jawbone, acting as a strong foundation for a crown, bridge, or full denture. Implants look, feel, and function just like real teeth.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">❓ Who is a good candidate for dental implants?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most healthy adults with missing teeth are good candidates for dental implants. Ideal candidates should have healthy gums, sufficient jawbone density, and be committed to maintaining good oral hygiene. If bone loss is present, procedures like bone grafting can make implants possible.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">❓ How long do dental implants last?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>With proper care, dental implants can last 20 years or more — and in many cases, they last a lifetime. Good oral hygiene habits, regular dental visits, and avoiding smoking all contribute to long-term implant success.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">❓ Is getting a dental implant painful?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most patients report minimal discomfort during and after the implant procedure. Our team uses gentle techniques, local anesthesia, and sedation options to ensure a smooth, comfortable experience. Minor swelling or soreness afterward typically subsides within a few days.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">❓ How long does the dental implant process take?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The full dental implant process usually takes 3 to 6 months, depending on your individual case. This includes implant placement, healing time (osseointegration), and placing the final crown or restoration. In some cases, same-day implants or immediate-load options are available.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2 class="faq-question">❓ How much do dental implants cost?</h2>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The cost of dental implants varies based on the number of implants, the type of restoration, and any additional procedures (like bone grafting) needed. At Philadelphia Dental Offices, we offer transparent pricing, financing options, and consultations to create a plan that fits your needs and budget.</p>
